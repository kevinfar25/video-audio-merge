# Video Audio Merge

A simple web application that merges video and audio files, cutting the video to match the audio duration (plus 0.5 seconds for smooth transitions).

## Features

- 🎬 Merge video files with new audio tracks
- ✂️ Automatically cuts video to audio length + 0.5s
- 🌐 Web interface for easy file uploads
- ⚡ Fast processing using FFmpeg
- 🐳 Docker-ready for deployment

## How It Works

When you upload a video and audio file:
1. The original video's audio is replaced with your new audio file
2. The video is cut to match the audio duration + 0.5 seconds
3. Perfect for when your video is longer than your audio track

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg installed on your system
- pip for Python package management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinfar25/video-audio-merge.git
cd video-audio-merge
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

3. Upload your video and audio files

4. Click "Merge Files" and download the result

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Web interface
- `POST /merge` - Upload and merge video/audio files
- `GET /download/{filename}` - Download merged files
- `GET /test-files` - List available test files
- `GET /test-file/{filename}` - Get test file for testing

## Docker Deployment (Coming Soon)

Docker configuration will be added for easy deployment to services like Coolify.

## Technical Details

- Uses FFmpeg's `-t` flag to set precise output duration
- Copies video codec without re-encoding for fast processing
- Encodes audio to AAC for compatibility
- Handles various video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)
- Supports multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC)
